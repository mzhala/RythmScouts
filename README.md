## Architecture & APIs

### üèó **Software Architecture**
- **MVVM / Fragment-based Architecture**: Keeps UI, data, and business logic separated  
- **Repository Pattern**: Data abstraction layer for clean architecture
- **Dependency Management**: Clean separation of concerns

### üî• **Backend Services**
- **Firebase Authentication**: For managing user accounts  
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: For storing user-specific event data  
- **Firebase Analytics**: Usage tracking and insights
- **Google Sign-In API**: OAuth integration for easy authentication

Got it! Here‚Äôs your **API Integration** section rewritten to perfectly match your `TicketmasterResponse` model and setup, formatted for GitHub README:

---

### üåê **API Integration**

* **Ticketmaster Discovery API**: Provides real-time event data including name, date, venue, city, and images.

  * `GET /discovery/v2/events` ‚Äì Fetch a list of events based on filters such as keyword, city, or date range.
  * `GET /discovery/v2/events/{id}` ‚Äì Retrieve detailed information for a specific event including venue, country, and location data.
  * `POST /users/{id}/savedEvents` ‚Äì Save selected events to the user‚Äôs Firebase account for tracking in the ‚ÄúMy Events‚Äù section.

* **Retrofit / OkHttp**: Used for all network requests to the Ticketmaster API, providing asynchronous handling and efficient response parsing.

* **API Response Model**: Maps to the Ticketmaster data structure using Kotlin data classes such as:

  * `TicketmasterResponse`, `Event`, `Image`, `Event Dates`, `Ticket startDateTime`, `Ticket endDateTime`, `Venue`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `City` and `Country`.

* **API Authentication**: Access is secured using a private Ticketmaster API key stored in the project configuration file.

## **GitHub Actions CI/CD**

RythmScouts uses GitHub Actions to automate the build and artifact generation process. The workflow triggers on **pushes to `release/**` branches** and can also be run manually via the Actions tab.

### **Workflow Features**

* **Run Unit Tests** ‚Äì Ensures that the project compiles and tests pass
* **Build APKs and AAB** ‚Äì Generates both debug and release APKs as well as a release App Bundle (AAB)
* **Upload Artifacts** ‚Äì Automatically uploads generated APKs and AABs to GitHub for download

### **Workflow Highlights**

* Uses **Ubuntu-latest** runner
* Sets up **JDK 17** with Gradle caching for faster builds
* Dynamically sets environment variables such as current date and repository name
* Builds:

  * Debug APK (`assembleDebug`)
  * Release APK (`assembleRelease`)
  * Release App Bundle (`bundleRelease`)
* Uploads artifacts to GitHub Actions for easy access

### **Example Workflow Snippet**

```yaml
name: Generated APK AAB (Upload - Create Artifact To Github Action)

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'release/**'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set current date
        run: echo "date_today=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Set repository name
        run: echo "repository_name=$(echo '${{ github.repository }}' | awk -F '/' '{print $2}')" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: 'zulu'
          java-version: '17'
          cache: 'gradle'
      - name: Change wrapper permissions
        run: chmod +x ./gradlew
      - name: Run tests
        run: ./gradlew test
      - name: Build project
        run: ./gradlew build
      - name: Build debug APK
        run: ./gradlew assembleDebug
      - name: Build release APK
        run: ./gradlew assemble
      - name: Build release AAB
        run: ./gradlew app:bundleRelease
      - name: Upload debug APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: ${{ env.date_today }} - Debug APK
          path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
      - name: Upload release APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: ${{ env.date_today }} - Release APK
          path: app/build/outputs/apk/release/
      - name: Upload release AAB
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: ${{ env.date_today }} - Release AAB
          path: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/
```

### **Benefits**

* Ensures that your app builds correctly for every release branch
* Provides downloadable APKs/AABs directly from GitHub Actions
